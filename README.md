# FRUGAL: Unlocking SSL for Software Analytics

## Case Studies:

[1] [Static Warning Analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-021-09948-6): Learning to recognize actionable static code warnings (is intrinsically easy)
- [Data](): originated from [Wang et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328084908_Is_there_a_golden_feature_set_for_static_warning_identification_an_experimental_evaluation)'s ''Is there a "golden" feature set for static warning identification?: an experimental evaluation'' 


[2] [Issue Close Time](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348588972_When_SIMPLE_is_better_than_complex_A_case_study_on_deep_learning_for_predicting_Bugzilla_issue_close_time): When SIMPLE is better than complex: A case study on deep learning for predicting Bugzilla issue close time
- [Data](): originated from [Lee et al.]() and [Mani et al.]()

## Methodology: 
- [CLA/CLAFI+ML](https://github.com/lifove/CLAMI) JAVA implementation from [Nam et. al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/ASE.2015.56)'s CLAMI: defect prediction on unlabeled datasets.
- ![FRUGAL](/CLA_4.png): FRUGAL finds the best combination of unsupervised learners = {CLA, CLA+ML, CLAFI+ML} and ùê∂ = {5% to 95% increments by 5%}.
